You are captured in an underground cell inside a dungeon. If you don't do anything in the next few seconds, you will most likely die.
What do you do?
Rot in your cell
Unlock the cell with the key next to you
Congratulations, you died on the first choice!
You unlocked the cell with the key. However, now you stand in an empty and dark hallway.
How will you continue?
March forward, like the brave man you are
Stay just where you are and wait
You march forward until you bump into something huge and sturdy - before you can even notice what's happening, you've already lost consciousness and, sadly, your life.
You wait for a while until you see a light at the end of the hallway. You think it's a good idea to approach it, and when you finally reach it, you find yourself in an open field.
Congratulations, you escaped the dungeon!
